                    <p>My name is Renée Wysocki. I am 24 years old and I live in Frisco, Texas with my boyfriend, Logan, and three dogs, Archer, Lana, and Sammy. 
                    <p>I grew up in Plano, Texas and I went to college at Keene State in New Hampshire for graphic design.
                        I ended up dropping out in the first year due to the death of my father. 
                        This prompted me to move back to Texas and seek out new opportunities. </p>

                   <p>I began a job as a secretary for a company specializing in heavy lifting and rigging equipment. 
                       There I was able to work my way up to become the Creative Director. 
                       This position allowed me to serve as the youngest female committee member in the Specialized Crane and Rigging Association (SC&RA).
                       I currently work as a freelance graphic designer but I am excited to start my career as a full-stack developer.</p> 

                    <p>My hobbies include horseback riding, cooking, cross-stitch, hiking, and kayaking. I also enjoy long walks on the beach with my boyfriend until the LSD wears off and I realize I'm dragging a stolen mannequin around a Wendy's parking lot.
